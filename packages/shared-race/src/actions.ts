/**
 * GitHub Actions on Beanstalk: the shared contract between the three lanes
 * (`docs/claude-opus/25-actions-and-automations.md`).
 *
 * - **Control plane** (the gateway): workflow discovery from the stalk, triggers, one
 *   `ActionsRunDO` per run owning the job DAG, limits, secrets, job tokens and the log relay.
 *   It serves `ActionsRpc` on the gateway Worker's named entrypoint `Actions` (bind with
 *   `{ "service": "beanstalk-gateway", "entrypoint": "Actions" }`), and `ActionsJobSink` on the
 *   named entrypoint `ActionsJobs` for the executor.
 * - **Executor** (lane 2): implements `ActionsExecutor` (`startJob`, `cancelJob`) on its own
 *   Worker's entrypoint, runs one container per job (D6), streams log batches and the result
 *   back through `ActionsJobSink` with the job's `report.token`.
 * - **UI** (lane 3): calls `ActionsRpc` through the service binding as the signed-in person.
 *
 * Every RPC returns `RpcResult`: expected failures are `{ ok: false, error }` with the HTTP
 * status the same failure would get (`not_found` 404, `forbidden` 403, `invalid_request` 400,
 * `invalid_state` 409, `over_limit` 429, `not_configured` 503).
 *
 * Access (`mayUseEngine`): `read` lists workflows, runs and logs; the `actions` action
 * (maintain) dispatches, cancels and manages secrets. Secret values are write-only: no method
 * returns one, except `actionsJobSecrets` to the executor, for the running job that names them.
 *
 * Limits (D9, beta defaults; vars on the gateway so self-hosters can change them): 100 Actions
 * minutes per repository per month, a 60-minute job timeout, 4 concurrent jobs per repository.
 * Logs are never stored in Durable Objects: the run DO relays live lines to watchers and writes
 * gzip chunks to R2 (`beanstalk-actions-logs`, 30-day lifecycle).
