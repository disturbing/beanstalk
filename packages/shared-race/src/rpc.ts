/**
 * The gateway's RPC surface for the web app (`packages/web`) and the MCP server
 * (`packages/mcp`), which reach it through a service binding to the `beanstalk-gateway`
 * Worker's default entrypoint. Workers RPC, not HTTP (AGENTS.md). The binding is the trust
 * boundary: the gateway does not authenticate these calls, so the web app must authenticate
 * its users before it calls `decide`, and the MCP server checks its callers' view tokens
 * with `verifyViewToken` before it reads anything.
 *
 * Every method returns a value: expected failures come back as `{ ok: false, error }`.
 * Everything is read-only except `decide`. Output sizes are bounded, and a `truncated`
 * flag says when a bound was hit.
