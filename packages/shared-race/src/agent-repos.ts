/**
 * Agents working on a person's repository through MCP (`docs/claude-opus/22-mcp-repository-tools.md`):
 * the gateway RPC the MCP Worker calls for its repository tools. Git stays the interface;
 * these calls add what git cannot say: which repositories a person may use, a reserved bean
 * name with its intent, a bean's verdict with the beans it collided with, and a shared
 * backlog whose tasks two agents cannot both claim.
 *
 * Like the rest of the binding, the gateway trusts its caller (the MCP Worker) for who the
 * person is and which scopes their session holds; it decides access itself, with the same
 * rule git uses (`mayUseEngine`).
