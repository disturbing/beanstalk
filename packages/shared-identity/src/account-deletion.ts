/**
 * Deleting an account. What happens is decided from facts the caller gathers (organisations
 * from accounts, repositories from the gateway), so the rule is testable on its own:
 *
 * - The sole owner of an organisation cannot delete their account: the organisation would be
 *   left with nobody to run it. They add another owner or delete the organisation first.
 * - Otherwise the person's own repositories are deleted with the account (the page lists
 *   them), they leave every repository and organisation they belong to, their agents are
 *   disconnected, and their passkeys, sessions, tokens, keys and retired handles go with the
 *   user row. Audit rows stay (ids, not secrets) so a deletion is traceable.
