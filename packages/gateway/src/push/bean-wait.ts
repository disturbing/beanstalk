 * of the pusher's beans in flight has its verdict, and prints them. `-o bean=<name>` (repeated)
 * names the beans instead of "every bean my credential has in flight", and one name re-attaches
 * to that bean's check. The engine's Durable Object wakes the waiting push when a bean changes
 * (`BeanWatchers`); the push asks again only then.
