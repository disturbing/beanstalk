# @gitstalk/gateway

The gateway is Gitstalk's control plane, deployed as the Worker `gitstalk-gateway`. It owns every repository: the registry in D1, the git data in Artifacts, and one continuous engine per repository that turns a `git push` into a bean and lands it. It is the only component that holds Artifacts tokens. People, agents and the other Workers reach repositories through it: git clients over its smart-HTTP proxy, the web app, the MCP server and the SSH server over Workers RPC, and the Actions executor through a named entrypoint. It also runs GitHub-compatible Actions and automations, and issues their OIDC tokens.

## Key concepts

- **Repositories.** A record in the `FORGE` D1 database (owner, name, visibility, profile, redirects after a rename or transfer) and a git repository in the `REPOS` Artifacts namespace. Creating one seeds its first commit (an empty start, a template, or an import of a public git repository) on both lines. Owners are people or organizations. See [20-repositories.md](../../docs/claude-opus/20-repositories.md).
- **The engine and landing.** Each repository has a continuous engine in a `RunDO` Durable Object. A bean is one agent's change, pushed to `bean/<name>`. The engine squashes it onto the **sprout** (the staged line) once its pre-land check passes on the exact merged tree, and moves the **stalk** (the stable line) only to validated sprout commits. A bean's phase is published as the tag `refs/beans/<name>/status`. Checks come from `.gitstalk/checks.toml` (`.beanstalk/` is still read), read from the tree being checked. See [18-git-native-flow.md](../../docs/claude-opus/18-git-native-flow.md) and [24-checks-config.md](../../docs/claude-opus/24-checks-config.md).
- **The git proxy.** `/git/<owner>/<repo>.git/*` serves clone, fetch and push. A push must be one `refs/heads/bean/<name>`; it is forwarded to Artifacts with a token the client never sees, then submitted to the engine, and the answer carries `remote:` lines (`git push -o wait` holds it for the verdict). Pushes to `sprout`, `stalk`, `main`, other branches and deletions are refused. Public repositories clone without a credential. `GET /v1/whoami` tells you whom a token belongs to.
- **Credentials.** One function, `verifyGitCredential` (`src/auth/git-credential.ts`), accepts people's tokens (`bsu_`, and `bss_` minted for an MCP session, checked against `IDENTITY_DB`), deploy tokens (`bsd_`), Actions job tokens (`bsj_`) and the gateway's own signed tokens (`bst1.`); `mayUseEngine` then decides what the holder may do. See [19-accounts-and-auth.md](../../docs/claude-opus/19-accounts-and-auth.md).
- **Collaborators and organizations.** Collaborators hold `read`, `write` or `maintain` on a repository, by invitation. An organization's repositories also grant access through the member's org role. Organization-level Actions secrets and variables live here too. See [22-collaborators.md](../../docs/claude-opus/22-collaborators.md) and [28-organizations.md](../../docs/claude-opus/28-organizations.md).
- **Repository events.** Engines publish landings, promotions, reverts, decisions and bean events to the `gitstalk-repo-events` queue. This Worker consumes it, writes the D1 indexes (beans, activity, daily counts) and tells Actions when the stalk moved.
- **Actions.** Workflows in `.github/workflows/` run unchanged: `ActionsRepoDO` (one per repository) indexes workflows, schedules and minutes; `ActionsRunDO` (one per run) owns the job graph, timeouts, cancellation and the live log relay. Jobs run on `gitstalk-actions-executor`, one container per job; logs go to R2. See [25-actions-and-automations.md](../../docs/claude-opus/25-actions-and-automations.md) and [26-actions-job-executor.md](../../docs/claude-opus/26-actions-job-executor.md).
- **Automations.** An automation file compiles to a single-job workflow on the same executor. Its agent loop calls the gateway's model proxy (`POST /v1/automations/model/chat/completions`) with its job token; the proxy calls Workers AI through AI Gateway and enforces a monthly budget per repository. Edits from the web's automation builder are saved as beans, so they land through the pre-land check like any other change.
- **OIDC issuer.** The gateway mounts the issuer from `@gitstalk/shared-oidc` at `/_actions/oidc` (discovery, JWKS, the job token endpoint) and gives each job `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` and `_TOKEN`. A request token is valid only while its job runs. Without the OIDC secrets, jobs get no OIDC variables and the routes answer `503`.
- **The runner container.** The `Runner` Container Durable Object drives the Rust image in [`container/`](container/README.md): squash and batch merges (with a structural merge tier), reverts, ref updates and sandboxed test suites. `RunnerCapacity` (one instance) shares the pool between engines (one pre-land sandbox per bean in check) and benchmark runs, and holds Actions leases against the executor's limit.

## RPC entrypoints

RPC between Workers goes through service bindings, never HTTP. The binding is the trust boundary: the gateway does not authenticate RPC callers, so the calling Worker authenticates its users first and passes a `Viewer` or principal. Shared types live in `@gitstalk/shared-race` (`rpc`, `repos`, `collaborators`, `agent-repos`, `actions` and others).

| Entrypoint | Bound by | What it serves |
|---|---|---|
| `Gateway` (default export) | `gitstalk-web` (`GATEWAY`), `gitstalk-mcp` (`GATEWAY`), `gitstalk-ssh` (`GATEWAY`) | Repositories (create, import, list, update, archive, transfer, delete, files, activity), deploy tokens, collaborators and invitations, account rename and close, repository reads (tree, file, diff, log, grep), engines (`openRepoEngine`, `gitToken`, `pushedBeans`, `engineFeeds`), the agent tools behind MCP (`agentRepositories`, `agentOpenBean`, `agentWaitBean`, backlog and task claims, bean collaboration threads and inbox), the automation editor, token checks (`verifyMcpToken`, `verifyViewToken`), and git over SSH (`sshKeyLookup`, `sshGit`). Also the HTTP routes and the queue consumer |
| `Actions` | `gitstalk-web` (`ACTIONS`) | Workflows, runs, dispatch, cancel, logs; repository and organization secrets and variables |
| `ActionsJobs` | `gitstalk-actions-executor` (`ACTIONS_JOBS`) | The executor's job reports and logs, authenticated by each job's report token, and the repository directory for its cache sweep |
| `StubActionsExecutor` | none (`ACTIONS_EXECUTOR_MODE = "stub"`) | An echo executor for local work and tests |

The method-level contract (bounds, error codes) for the run and repository read methods is in [31-gateway-engine-internals.md](../../docs/claude-opus/31-gateway-engine-internals.md), "RPC for the web app".

## Develop

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars        # then fill in the secrets below
pnpm -F @gitstalk/gateway dev         # wrangler dev; needs Docker (runner) and a Cloudflare login (Artifacts is remote-only)
pnpm -F @gitstalk/gateway test        # vitest on Miniflare; no network
pnpm -F @gitstalk/gateway typecheck
pnpm -F @gitstalk/gateway types       # regenerate worker-configuration.d.ts after editing wrangler.jsonc
cargo test -p runner                  # the runner container's tests
pnpm check                            # at the root, before you report work as done
```

`ADMIN_TOKEN` and `RUN_TOKEN_SECRET` must each be at least 32 characters; a shorter one makes every request answer `500 misconfigured`. `.dev.vars.example` does not list `ACTIONS_SECRETS_KEY` yet; add it (32 random bytes, base64) to use Actions secrets locally.

## Configuration

All names below come from `wrangler.jsonc`; values are never committed.

- **Durable Objects:** `RUNS` (`RunDO`), `RUN_INDEX` (`RunIndex`), `RUN_STREAMS` (`RunStreamDO`), `RUNNER` (`Runner`, a container class), `RUNNER_CAPACITY` (`RunnerCapacity`), `ACTIONS_REPOS` (`ActionsRepoDO`), `ACTIONS_RUNS` (`ActionsRunDO`).
- **Container:** `Runner`, image `./container/Dockerfile`, build context the repository root, `standard-4`, `max_instances` 48 (must equal `RUNNER_MAX_INSTANCES`).
- **Artifacts:** `REPOS` (namespace `gitstalk-repos`, people's repositories), `ARTIFACTS` (`gitstalk-race`, benchmark run repositories).
- **D1:** `FORGE` (`gitstalk-forge`, migrations in `migrations/`), `IDENTITY_DB` (`gitstalk-identity`, schema in `packages/shared-identity/migrations`).
- **Queue:** `REPO_EVENTS`, producer and consumer of `gitstalk-repo-events`.
- **R2:** `ACTIONS_LOGS` (`gitstalk-actions-logs`). **Analytics Engine:** `PRODUCT_EVENTS`. **Workers AI:** `AI`.
- **Service:** `ACTIONS_EXECUTOR` (`gitstalk-actions-executor`).
- **Vars:** `LOG_LEVEL`, `ARTIFACTS_NAMESPACE`, `RUN_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`, `ARTIFACTS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`, `WEB_URL`, `PUBLIC_URL`, `RUNNER_MAX_INSTANCES`, `ACTIONS_EXECUTOR_MODE` (`service` or `stub`), `ACTIONS_MAX_INSTANCES`, `ACTIONS_MONTHLY_MINUTES`, `ACTIONS_JOB_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`, `ACTIONS_CONCURRENT_JOBS`, `AUTOMATIONS_AI_GATEWAY`, `AUTOMATIONS_MONTHLY_USD`.
- **Secrets (required):** `ADMIN_TOKEN` (admin API), `RUN_TOKEN_SECRET` (signs `bst1.` tokens), `ACTIONS_SECRETS_KEY` (encrypts Actions secrets at rest).
- **Secrets (optional, OIDC):** `OIDC_SIGNING_KEYS`, `OIDC_REQUEST_SECRET`, `OIDC_REQUEST_SECRET_PREVIOUS`, and the var `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` (default `<gateway>/_actions/oidc`). Generate keys with `packages/shared-oidc/scripts/oidc-keys.mjs`.

`wrangler.jsonc` is a template. Deploy through an environment: `pnpm env:provision <env>`, `pnpm env:secrets <env>`, then `pnpm env:deploy <env> --only gateway`, which also stamps the runner image with its commit. See [30-environments.md](../../docs/claude-opus/30-environments.md). Never `wrangler deploy` the template; the package's `deploy` script fails on purpose.

## Benchmark runs (admin only)

The gateway still hosts the benchmark machinery used to compare Gitstalk with a merge queue: `/v1/runs` (create, seed, start, stop, events, decision cards, the driver's long-poll API), `/v1/admin` (halt switch, sweep, capacity) and the live page at `/runs/:run`. All of it requires `ADMIN_TOKEN` or tokens it issues. The engine's settings, the driver contract and the race history are in [31-gateway-engine-internals.md](../../docs/claude-opus/31-gateway-engine-internals.md); the tooling is in [research/README.md](../../research/README.md) and [research/race/](../../research/race/).
