# Gitstalk

**Watch your work grow like a beanstalk.**

Gitstalk is an agent-first git forge built on Cloudflare. When many coding agents work on one codebase, a merge queue makes them wait in line. Gitstalk lets them land without waiting: it checks every change on the exact tree it would land on, sends a failure back to the agent that wrote the change together with the change that broke it, and asks a human only when two specifications genuinely disagree. Agents grow together.

- A **bean** is one agent's change: a branch named `bean/<name>`.
- The **sprout** is the staged line. A bean lands there as soon as its pre-land check passes on the exact merged tree.
- The **stalk** is the stable line. It moves only to sprout commits that passed validation, so it stays green.

Gitstalk was called Beanstalk until 2026-10-10; the beans, sprout and stalk kept their names.

## Use it

The hosted service is at **[gitstalk.io](https://gitstalk.io)**, with documentation at [gitstalk.io/docs](https://gitstalk.io/docs). Agents connect over MCP at `https://mcp.gitstalk.io/mcp`. The Claude Code and Codex plugin lives in its own repository, [disturbing/gitstalk-plugin](https://github.com/disturbing/gitstalk-plugin):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add disturbing/gitstalk-plugin && claude plugin install gitstalk@gitstalk
codex plugin marketplace add disturbing/gitstalk-plugin && codex plugin add gitstalk@gitstalk && codex mcp login gitstalk
```

Any git client works too: clone over HTTPS or SSH, and push a `bean/<name>` branch to propose a change.

## Architecture

Every piece is a Cloudflare Worker. Workers call each other through service bindings (Workers RPC), and three Rust containers do the work that needs a real filesystem.

             KV (OAuth) · R2 (logs, dependency cache, media) · Queues (repository events) · Workers AI
```

The gateway is the only component that holds Artifacts tokens; every repository read or write goes through it. Agents never merge to the stable line themselves. A longer walkthrough is in the public docs ([architecture](packages/site/public/docs/architecture.html)) and in each package's README.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`packages/gateway`](packages/gateway/README.md) | Control plane: repositories, the per-repository engine, git smart-HTTP proxy, RPC entrypoints, Actions, automations, OIDC issuer; owns the runner container ([`container/`](packages/gateway/container/README.md)) |
| [`packages/web`](packages/web/README.md) | The web app (vinext, Next.js App Router on Workers) |
| [`packages/mcp`](packages/mcp/README.md) | The MCP server agents connect to, with OAuth |
| [`packages/ssh`](packages/ssh/README.md) | Git over SSH; owns the SSH server container ([`container/`](packages/ssh/container/README.md)) |
| [`packages/actions-executor`](packages/actions-executor/README.md) | Runs GitHub Actions jobs and the dependency cache; owns the job container ([`container/`](packages/actions-executor/container/README.md)) |
| [`packages/site`](packages/site/README.md) | Marketing site and public documentation (static assets) |
| [`packages/shared-*`](packages/) | Libraries bundled into the Workers: [`shared-race`](packages/shared-race/README.md) (RPC and engine contracts), [`shared-identity`](packages/shared-identity/README.md), [`shared-ask`](packages/shared-ask/README.md), [`shared-media`](packages/shared-media/README.md), [`shared-oidc`](packages/shared-oidc/README.md) |
| [`research/`](research/README.md) | Experiments, the benchmark harness and its recorded runs, prototypes; not part of the build |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | Design documents and experiment write-ups (`docs/claude-opus/` is the most current set) |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Repository tooling: environments and deploys, Rust checks, the public-docs check |
| [`environments/`](environments/example/) | Deploy environments; only `example/` is public |

## Contributing quick start

Prerequisites: Node 24 or later, pnpm 11 (the version is pinned in `package.json`'s `packageManager`), the Rust toolchain named in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) (`rustup toolchain install` in the repository root installs it, with clippy and rustfmt), and Docker for building the container images. Wrangler is a workspace dev dependency, so `pnpm install` brings it.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check                          # format, lint, typecheck, TypeScript tests, Rust fmt/clippy/tests
pnpm -F @gitstalk/<package> test    # one package's tests
pnpm -F @gitstalk/<package> dev     # run one Worker locally (wrangler dev, or vite for the web app)
```

Local development of the gateway, web app and MCP server needs `wrangler login`, because Artifacts and Workers AI bindings are remote-only; the site runs offline. Each package's README lists its commands and the `.dev.vars` it needs. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.

## Self-hosting

You can run your own copy on a Cloudflare account with Workers Paid, Containers, Artifacts and Workers AI. An environment is one directory under `environments/<name>/` (copy `environments/example/`); the scripts create its resources, push its secrets and deploy every package in order:

```bash
pnpm env:provision <env>            # create D1, KV, R2, queues; record ids; migrate D1
pnpm env:secrets <env>              # push Worker secrets (never printed)
pnpm env:deploy <env>               # deploy every package (--dry-run, --only <package>)
pnpm env:smoke <env>                # smoke-test the deployed stack
```

The `wrangler.jsonc` files in `packages/` are templates: never `wrangler deploy` one directly (each package's `deploy` script refuses on purpose). The full guide is [`docs/claude-opus/30-environments.md`](docs/claude-opus/30-environments.md), with a shorter public version at [self-hosting](packages/site/public/docs/self-hosting.html). Mind the [license](#license): self-hosting for your own use is permitted; offering Gitstalk as a competing service is not.

## Benchmark results

The same 38 real changes from fastify's history (merged upstream pull requests, each with its own tests) were pushed in parallel to a GitHub repository using GitHub's merge queue and Actions, and to a Gitstalk repository, with CI capacity matched. Time from "ready" to merged, median:

| Parallel workers | GitHub merge queue | Gitstalk | Faster |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 2.9 min | 0.7 min | 4.1x |
| 8 | 3.7 min | 0.8 min | 4.6x |
| 16 (three seeds) | 6.6-7.1 min | 0.8-1.1 min | 6.5-8.9x |

Every run landed all 38 changes correctly on both forges. The 4- and 8-worker rows are one seed each, and CI minutes are not like for like. Method, caveats, the synthetic 30-agent arena and every recorded run: [`research/README.md`](research/README.md), [`research/race/loadgen/README.md`](research/race/loadgen/README.md) and [`docs/claude-opus/11-experiments-summary.md`](docs/claude-opus/11-experiments-summary.md).
