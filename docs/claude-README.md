# beanstalk docs (Claude set), 2026-10-03

> **Renamed 2026-10-10.** The product is now **Gitstalk** (owner's decision: "Beanstalk" clashed with beanstalkapp.com and beanstalk.ai was taken). The growing-beanstalk metaphor stays. The history and research docs in this folder (`0*`, `claude-0*`, `claude-1*`, `claude-opus/01`–`15`, `claude-opus/exp`, `claude-opus/research`, `research/`) keep the old name as written; the current design docs (`claude-opus/16`–`30`), `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, the skills and the public docs say Gitstalk. What was renamed and what kept its name: `claude-opus/30-environments.md` §12.

Two models worked this brief in parallel on the same day. Files without a prefix (`01-` to `07-`, `canvas-concept.html`, `github-repository-map/`) are Codex's. Files prefixed `claude-` are this set. They overlap on purpose and disagree in places; the disagreements are listed at the bottom.

Repo standards for agents live outside this folder: `AGENTS.md` (canonical; `CLAUDE.md` imports it) and the skills in `.agents/skills/` (`clean-code-typescript`, `clean-code-rust`, `gitstalk-packages`, plus eight vendored Cloudflare skills). Load the matching skill before writing code.

## Read in this order

| File | What it is | Minutes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-00-competition-brief.md` | Rules, rubric weights (50/25/25), deadlines, the US/Canada eligibility flag, what Cloudflare shipped | 3 |
| `claude-10-beanstalk-thesis.md` | The design: agents work in forks (sprouts), the Integrator assembles beans into worlds, humans choose between worlds; eight objects; the concurrency model; platform constraints; Steward comparison | 10 |
| `claude-11-ideas-brainstorm.md` | 43 ideas scored against the rubric with "what kills it" lines and prior art; demo shortlist | 12 |
| `claude-12-jev-canvas-design.md` | The question-to-interface canvas grounded in what Jev actually is (TypeSafe System One) and in the generative-UI evidence; 17 cards; pipeline; honest critique | 8 |
| `claude-13-demo-plan.md` | Build order Oct 3 to 14, cut lines, the seven-minute script, risks to retire in 48 hours | 5 |
| `claude-14-self-critique-and-decisions.md` | Independent red team of the thesis, what we concede, and the decisions only Coop can make | 6 |
| `claude-14b-red-team-critique.md` | The red team's full report, verbatim | 8 |
| `claude-15-fast-reads-and-search-on-edge.md` | How no-clone agents get grep-speed reads and search on the edge: blob-keyed index in a per-project DO, git trees as the Merkle tree, brute-force regex tier for the demo, trigram and Vectorize tiers later, five MCP read tools; bench plan due Oct 8 | 12 |
| `claude-16-checkout-protocol-and-live-edits.md` | How agents check out and edit Artifacts repos: real clones through beanstalk's git proxy with a credential helper (partial clone verified to work), no-clone MCP only for non-coding roles, a two-tier live-edit channel (event stream under 1 s, `refs/wip` checkpoints under 6 s), one actor per sprout, measured against a probe repo | 12 |
| `claude-17-streaming-diffs.md` | Streaming diffs, second design: why the first design (whole snapshots through the engine's RunDO, viewers pulling patches) is slow at 30 agents, and the replacement: a `RunStreamDO` per run, incremental posts with `base_seq` and `resync`, patches pushed to subscribed viewers, summaries to all | 6 |

## Research memos (evidence behind the above)

| File | Topic | Strongest finding |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-01-community-pain-points.md` | 71 sourced quotes from HN, Lobsters, Discourse, GitHub, maintainer blogs; top-15 pains; verbatim wishlist | Review is the bottleneck; OSS intake is collapsing into bans; GitHub reliability is the loudest thread; agents silently overwrite each other |
| `claude-02-merge-queues-and-agent-pr-research.md` | Empirical papers on agent PRs; nine merge-queue systems compared; structured merge, patch theory, jj; 12 requirements for a 10,000-agent merge system | 41.7% textual conflict rate between co-active PRs from different agents; 22.1% of dead fix PRs were "resolved by another PR"; review time +441% |
| `claude-03-the-race-to-replace-github.md` | Cursor Origin and Continuity, Cursor's thousand-agent swarm post-mortem, Zed Delta, Entire, Foremerge, JetBrains Air, Cloudflare's own hint | Cursor's lead: differentiator from GitHub is "today, very little"; locks collapse 20 agents to the throughput of 3; nobody rethought integration |
| `claude-03b-cursor-origin-feature-inventory.md` | The deep-dive memo behind 03: Origin inventory, GitHub's moves, substrate and workflow competitors, ten unbuilt things | Steward (2026-10-02) is the closest rival entry |
| `claude-04-cloudflare-artifacts-and-primitives.md` | Exact Artifacts binding, REST, git protocol, events, Builds previews, limits, pricing; DO, Workflows, Containers, Sandbox, Dynamic Workers, MCP auth | No server-side merge, diff, refs or hooks; push is protocol v1; 1 GB per repo; 2,000 requests per 10 s per repo |
| `claude-05-github-actions-on-cloudflare.md` | 34-row GitHub Actions compatibility matrix (act, Gitea, beanstalk on Containers); three architectures; limitations to publish | Build the Worker-side services (cache, artifacts, OIDC, token) first; Docker-in-Docker is the one unresolved blocker |
| `claude-06-identity-mcp-and-previews.md` | GitHub auth pain; identity models (SPIFFE, WAG, Biscuit); 28-tool MCP list; three preview architectures; prompt-injection design | Agents never hold Artifacts tokens; merge is never an agent capability; 30 tools maximum because of client limits |
| `claude-07-generative-ui-and-canvas-research.md` | Generative UI approaches, canvas evidence, repo-visualisation prior art, swarm dashboards, critique, recommended architecture | No product renders agents on the codebase; generated layouts kill muscle memory; schema-stable cards win |

Raw search results and full-thread fetches sit in the session scratchpad, not in the repo.

## Where the Claude set and the Codex set disagree

1. **Jev.** Codex treats "Jev" as the name of the chat interface. Jev is TypeSafe's typed decision model; it cannot write text, which is why `claude-12` puts it at card selection and routing and keeps Claude for narration.
2. **How bold to be.** Codex's thesis warns against "a novel Git replacement" and keeps PRs as the everyday view. `claude-10` keeps git and PR export but replaces the merge step with worlds, because the rubric pays 50% for originality and Steward already occupies the conservative "PR as decision" ground.
3. **Concurrency claim.** Both agree the honest demo is thousands registered, hundreds active. Codex sizes it (100 workspaces, 40 jobs, 12 previews, 2 lanes); `claude-13` uses 100 sprouts, 40 active, 8 evidence jobs.
4. **GitHub Actions.** Both land on Containers for Linux jobs with a compatibility report. Codex adds Dynamic Workers for policy evaluation; `claude-05` recommends building the Worker-side service shims first and bootstrapping with act in host mode.
5. **The repository's home.** Codex `03` and `claude-12` put a spatial canvas at the centre, and `claude-opus/13` a GitHub-style three-pane explorer. `claude-opus/14` replaces both with the Plot (landings by time × area of code, the swarm at the tip). Coop chose it on 2026-10-04: it is `/runs/:run`, the explorer moved to `/runs/:run/files`, and the race canvas is the developer view at `/runs/:run/race`.
6. **Algorithm optimization follow-up (Codex, 2026-10-06).** [Codex `09b`](09b-algorithm-optimization-review.md) reviews Opus `11` through the 30-agent post-mortem and scheduler fix `0880dae`, and proposes adaptive checkpoint recovery, shared diagnosis and reusable checks. It confirms the parked-scheduler fix; its recorded `burst30` assertion mismatch was subsequently re-pinned in `d4e6bc4` to 36 green / 4 parked. It calls for measuring replay conflicts and rework before removing all bisection, and distinguishes the current flake policy (different failures on two red runs can count as green) from an actually passing suite. The 30-agent queue's saved summaries and events record 35 final greens, versus 36 in the post-mortem's prose. Proposed algorithm gains remain unmeasured.
7. **Productive thousand-agent scale (Codex, 2026-10-06).** [Codex `09c`](09c-thousand-agent-collaboration.md) extends the existing contract, planning, evidence and decision ideas with conditional receipts, executable shared findings, typed operations and scoped multi-party failure knowledge. It qualifies E4's low committer utilization: 70% of historical changes never applied, so that replay does not establish capacity for 1,000 productive writers. Its calculator gives hypothetical capacity demands, not measured throughput; live productivity gains remain to be tested.
8. **Agent-agnostic contribution (owner direction, 2026-10-06).** Coop wants the forge to provide tools to independently operated agents, with bean intents, evolving approaches, small modification requests and shared promises supporting communication through plugins. This supersedes Opus `02`'s assumption that the forge assigns all work and agents do not negotiate as the public collaboration model. [Codex `09d`](09d-bean-intents-and-agent-communication.md) records the proposed protocol and checks Jev/Clef retrieval helpers and Cloudflare Agent Memory (private beta). The writable communication layer is now implemented locally; [Codex `09e`](09e-bean-collaboration-implementation.md) records the API and its current run-scoped limits.
