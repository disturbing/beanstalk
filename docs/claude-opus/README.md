# Beanstalk docs: second Claude set (Opus 5.5), 2026-10-03

Three sessions worked the same brief in parallel:
- **Codex:** the unprefixed files in `docs/`.
- **One Claude session:** the `claude-*` files in `docs/`.
- **This session:** this folder.

I did my research independently first (four research agents, using web search and Exa). I then read only the other sets' headings and idea titles, and wrote this set to **add to them rather than repeat them**. Where this set agrees, it points to their docs; where it disagrees, it says so (`07` §2).

## The idea in one paragraph

Treat thousands of agents like concurrent database transactions over one codebase:
- **Place work before it starts.** Predict each task's footprint, and never run colliding tasks at the same time. This is placement, not locks.
- **Let agents commit without waiting** to a fast trunk.
- **Record what every change read and wrote,** so a semantic break is traced to the exact pair of commits that caused it and handed to a fixer agent along with that cause.
- **Make the speed-versus-safety trade an explicit dial:** isolation levels per path, plus an error budget with a controller.
- **Humans read a green branch** that only moves forward on verified, attested snapshots, and act on decision cards instead of diffs.

The evidence behind it:
- Cursor found that locks reduced 20 agents to the throughput of 1–3, and that its single integrator gate became "an obvious bottleneck."
- Different agents' PRs conflict 41.7% of the time.
- GitHub's merge queue silently reverted 2,092 PRs.

The old research ideas this builds on (Crystal 2011, Cassandra 2013) failed for humans because people won't declare tasks or let a tool reassign them. With agents the forge dispatches every task and sees every read, so they now work.

## Ten takeaways

1. **The unsolved problem is coordination before code exists.** Write-path scale is crowded (Cursor Continuity, Entire, Pierre, GitLab, ERSC, Artifacts); nobody ships pre-code coordination. Cloudflare's brief asks exactly this.
2. **Nothing should block agents on the hot path.** Per-commit correctness, locks and single gates all serialized Cursor's swarm. Correctness should come by convergence, with a fast trunk, asynchronous validation and a green branch.
3. **Textual merge misses the conflicts that matter.** Read-write conflicts merge cleanly and break later. Agents read through the forge, so the forge can see them.
4. **Make the dial explicit:** isolation levels per path, plus an error budget. A team can start fully `serializable` (a well-scheduled merge queue) and loosen path by path.
5. **Demo a race, not a tour.** The same tasks run on the same engine twice: once preset as a good batched merge queue, once as Beanstalk. Score only verified changes reaching green per hour and agent-minutes spent waiting, because fast-trunk landings would win trivially. If Beanstalk doesn't win on green throughput, the thesis is wrong; find out on day 2.
6. **Jev picks; it doesn't generate.** It is ideal for type-ahead routing (about 300 ms, fractions of a cent) over a fixed map and a catalog that grows through review. Keep a fallback router.
7. **Actions YAML can run unchanged for most Linux jobs.** The cost is rebuilding GitHub's server side, a Docker host-network shim, a `*.localhost` shim for artifacts v4, and a new OIDC issuer. macOS, Windows, arm64 and GPU jobs need bring-your-own runners. Actions Doctor sets expectations before migration.
8. **Artifacts' per-repo tokens become branch protection.** Agents only ever hold fork tokens; trunk, green and governance tokens never leave Beanstalk's own services.
9. **Prevent the GitLost class by construction:** session taint enforces the Rule of Two, and every public incident becomes a regression test.
10. **Previews should be MCP verbs:** ensure, http, browse, compare against green, logs, attest. They need isolated, seeded data, because Cloudflare's Worker Previews share D1, KV, R2 and Queues with production by default.

## Before anything else

The rules require the entrant to be a **legal resident of the US or Canada**, and the winner must attend in person in San Francisco on 10-21. See `07` §3, decision 1.

## Method notes

- **Reddit couldn't be reached** (403s, no Exa index, and the archive mirror refused agents). Reddit sentiment is second-hand and marked. Hacker News threads were read comment by comment through the Algolia API.
- **Labels:** facts carry links; estimates are labelled *illustrative*; vendor numbers are marked.
- **Not in the repo:** raw search output stayed in the session scratchpad. Only the curated research memos are here.
